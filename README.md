# Mad Libs

## Explanation of the app
With this app you can create “Mad Libs”. Mad Libs are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in. In the non-computerized version of this game, you ask someone to fill in each of the placeholders without telling them anything about the overall story. Once all placeholders are filled in, you show them the resulting silly story. This app is a computerized verson of it.

## Implemented extra's
- I've created two landscape views. One for the first page and one for the second page.
- I also made the words that are filled in by the user of the app bold.

This extra's are shown in the section "Screenshots of the app".
